The Milky Way black hole is called Sagittarius A*, near the border of Sagittarius and Scorpius constellations. (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration via AP)NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have spotted what appear to be two stars whipping around each other near the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.Nearly every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart. The one in the middle of the Milky Way, called Sagittarius A (with an asterisk denoting star), is about 4 million times more massive than our sun and is relatively quiet, occasionally swallowing gas or dust that comes its way.Scientists know stars can form near and even orbit these black hole behemoths, but they've never seen a pair of stars survive so close by.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe research was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.The celestial sighting is interesting and unusual, and more research is needed to be certain of what the objects are, said astrophysicist Anna Ciurlo with the University of California, Los Angeles.“This leaves some questions still open,” said Ciurlo, who was not involved with the new research.At about 2.7 million years old, the twin stars seem to be fairly young. Scientists said they appear to orbit each other at just the right distance: If they were too spread out, the black hole's gravity would rip them apart. Any closer and they'd merge into a single star.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementEven so, the cosmic duo won't stay stable forever. They could meld into one eventually though the timing is uncertain, said study lead author Florian Peissker from the University of Cologne.“We are actually in a really lucky situation,” he said. “We observed the system just in time.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier, File)SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Almost three dozen high-rise condos and luxury hotels along the beach in South Florida are sinking or settling in unexpected ways, in some cases because of nearby construction, according to a new study.The 35 buildings surveyed along an almost 12-mile (19 kilometer) stretch from Miami Beach to Sunny Isles Beach have sunk or settled by 0.8 to 3.1 inches (2 to 8 cm). About half of the buildings are less than a decade old, according to scientists at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The study was published Friday.“The discovery of the extent of subsidence hotspots along the South Florida coastline was unexpected,” Farzaneh Aziz Zanjani, the lead author, said in a statement. “The study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and a deeper understanding of the long-term implications for these structures.”AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementIt's not uncommon for buildings to sink a little during and soon after construction, but the scientists called their discovery surprising because some of the changes took place several years later.Limestone under the South Florida beach is interspersed with layers of sand, which can shift under the weight of high-rises and as a result of vibrations from foundation construction. Tidal flows also play a role. The study used satellite images to capture the changes, with settling most noticeable in buildings in Sunny Isles Beach. The scientists said preliminary data also suggests sinking or settling further north, along the beaches of Broward and Palm Beach counties.The stretch of South Florida communities surveyed included Surfside, where the Champlain Towers South building collapsed in June 2021, killing 98 people. However, that collapse is thought to have been caused by reinforced concrete that deteriorated due to poor maintenance and flawed design.Still, the Surfside catastrophe highlighted the need to monitor building stability "especially in coastal areas with corrosive environmental conditions,” the scientists said.AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword17,967 people played the daily Crossword recently.

Then, the attackers tossed the remnants of the bodies down a 49.2-foot (15-meter) natural shaft linked to a cave system.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe grisly find represents the largest example of interpersonal violence from this period in Britain, according to the authors of a study describing the findings, which published Sunday in the journal Antiquity.The bones are rare, direct evidence that point to a cycle of violence at a time during the Early Bronze Age that experts had once considered to be largely peaceful in Britain. Most of the hundreds of human skeletons recovered from 2500 to 1500 BC in the country typically have not contained evidence of brutality, the study authors said.“We actually find more evidence for injuries to skeletons dating to the Neolithic period (10,000 BC to 2,200 BC) in Britain than the Early Bronze Age, so Charterhouse Warren stands out as something very unusual,” said lead study author Rick Schulting, professor of scientific and prehistoric archaeology at the University of Oxford, in a statement.“It paints a considerably darker picture of the period than many would have expected.”The researchers believe the intent behind the extreme treatment of the victims’ remains was to dehumanize them as revenge after some perceived grievous offense. But trying to determine the exact motive from unknown attackers during a time before written documents existed in the region is proving difficult.Uncovering a horrific siteExcavations took place at the Charterhouse Warren shaft, which is part of a limestone plateau, in the 1970s and 1980s as part of an effort to better understand the subterranean cave system. There, researchers unearthed piles of buried human bones, mixed in with cattle bones, that told the story of mass violence striking an ancient community.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMultiple studies have covered the site and its contents since their discovery. But the find drew Schulting’s attention in 2016 thanks to his colleague and study coauthor Dr. Louise Loe, head of Oxford Archaeology’s Heritage Burial Services, who excavates and analyzes human skeletons from archaeological sites. Loe had studied the remains and knew Schulting was interested in documenting evidence of prehistoric violence.“We examined some of the material together and it quickly became clear that the extent of modifications to the bones were far beyond what either of us had ever seen,” Schulting said. “So the project developed to tell the story of the site.”Cutmarks can be seen on the mandible of a 10-year-old child. - Schulting et al. 2024An analysis of the bones revealed that many of the skulls showed fatal impacts from blunt force trauma, but the violence didn’t end there. Numerous cutmarks covering the bones and fractures at or near the time of death showed that the victims’ heads, arms, feet and legs had been removed from their bodies using stone tools. There was also evidence to show that their scalps and skin had been removed, as well as some heads with removed lower jaws and potentially tongues.“In addition, a small number of small bones of the hands and feet exhibit fresh bone crushing fractures that are consistent with the flat molars of omnivores, including humans, rather than the sharper punctures caused by carnivores,” the authors wrote in the study, noting that the body parts were buried quickly after being butchered and cannibalized, making scavenging by animals highly unlikely.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMore in WorldTrail Runner Tina Lewis Arrested in India for Traveling With an InReach DeviceExplorersWebMoving abroad can be expensive: These 5 countries will 'pay' you to move thereUSA TODAYMy husband and I moved to a small Italian town with $1 homes. We were anxious it would be a lifeless place but were pleasantly surprised.INSIDERUkraine says North Koreans took heavy casualties during weekend attack in Kursk regionCNNThe bone analysis also showed that almost all of the victims were local to the area, suggesting that the attackers invaded the community to carry out their brutal acts. What’s more, the extreme manner in which the remains were handled is beyond what Schulting and his colleagues have seen from remains of ancient animals who were butchered.“The most surprising thing is the sheer extent of the butchery of the bodies,” Schulting said. “They were killed with blows to the head, and then systematically dismembered, defleshed, bones smashed apart.”The researchers believe the bones are all from a single event. But given that there are different layers of material found within the shaft, the animal and human remains within it may have been deposited “over decades and up to a century or so is possible,” according to the study.“The location itself may be the common denominator; the natural shaft and large underlying cave system inviting comparisons with a portal to the underworld,” the study authors wrote.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBut the biggest question is why this community was brutalized in the first place. In order to glean the reasons, the team looked back over time for similar violent events.A history of violenceFor context, the researchers looked to the nearby Paleolithic site of Gough’s Cave in Cheddar Gorge, just 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to the west. There, prior excavations revealed six individuals whose bones had been dismembered and butchered, including potential human chew marks on hand, foot and rib bones. But there is no evidence that the people who cannibalized them actually killed their victims, implying that the cannibalism was actually a form of funerary ritual, the study authors said.Researchers have found evidence of warfare carried out with bows and arrows at Bronze Age sites, and evidence exists from the Early Neolithic about 1,500 years before Charterhouse when weapons like swords began to appear in the historical record, Schulting said.But the Charterhouse Warren victims showed no signs of putting up a fight, suggesting a substantial part of a community was caught off guard or held captive and massacred, and that how they were dealt with afterward was far different from ritual.AdvertisementAdvertisementThere are a few limited examples of victims of violence being buried, like a young male found in a ditch at Stonehenge who was shot multiple times with arrows, according to the study authors. But funeral rituals largely included cremation or burials of multiple individuals together, rather than what was found at Charterhouse Warren.The researchers don’t believe the people were killed as food due to starvation, given the abundant amount of cattle bones found mixed in with the human bones.Instead, the study authors believe cannibalism may have been an extreme form of dehumanizing the victims by “othering” the deceased, or eating their flesh and mixing their bones with cattle bones as a way to liken the victims to animals, the researchers said.Innovations in weaponry, like daggers, suggest that interpersonal violence was occurring at the time in Early Bronze Age Britain, said Barry Molloy, an associate professor in the school of archaeology at University College Dublin. Enemies could be considered “others, people so distant from your group that extreme violence against them became acceptable,” said Molloy, who was not involved in the study.Multiple skulls from the site show where attackers dealt fatal blows to the victims. - Schulting et al. 2024Population turnovers in Britain within the centuries surrounding the event suggest exceptional othering was happening as new groups took over parts of Britain, Molloy said.AdvertisementAdvertisement“How far people in prehistoric Europe were willing to dehumanise and brutalise the othered enemy group is writ large at (Charterhouse Warren),” he said.But what could have necessitated such a dramatic act? The study authors don’t believe the attackers were fighting for control of resources at the site, and climate change didn’t seem to have an impact on conflict in Britain at the time.While it’s impossible to know the ancestry of the attackers, there is no evidence to suggest a clash of communities with different ancestries or ethnicities.An extreme form of revengeUnderstanding motivations in prehistory before written records existed in Britain is incredibly challenging, Schulting said. But the sheer number of victims means there must have been an even larger number of aggressors, he said.AdvertisementAdvertisementAnalysis of DNA from the bones is in progress to determine how closely related the victims were, and the research team also intends to study the animal bones going forward, Schulting said.Cut marks can be seen on a human scapula found in the shaft. - Schulting et al. 2024And there is evidence within the teeth of two of the child victims that they had the plague, based on previous research, although it’s unclear how it may have been linked to the violent episode.“Possibly this was seen as revenge for some transgression,” Schulting said. “Such violent acts can emerge in a climate of anger and fear — there is evidence that some individuals had the plague, which may have contributed to a sense of fear and uncertainty. Tensions may have built up from relatively innocuous beginnings (theft, accusations of witchcraft, and so on) and then escalated out of control.”Molloy said that while the theory of a single massacre is compelling, it’s more chilling to think that this phenomenon took place across multiple instances, possibly normalizing cannibalism.AdvertisementAdvertisement“Sometimes a single site can radically change our perceptions, and I think that Charterhouse has the potential to do just that,” Schulting said. “The extreme violence seen here is unlikely to have been an isolated incident. There would have been repercussions, as the relatives and friends of the victims sought revenge, and this could have led to cycles of violence in the region.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.comAdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword17,967 people played the daily Crossword recently.

Furthermore, high-value collectibles snagged from those distant spots would be hauled back to Earth by astronauts.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementNASA has begun blueprinting the Endurance rover to traverse the gigantic South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin, a lunar wonderland of promising geological surprises. Endurance would be an unprecedented undertaking.High priorityPutting emphasis on building Endurance was the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in its report, "Origins, Worlds, and Life - A Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023-2032."Billed as a strategic medium-class mission, it was given the highest priority within NASA's Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program (LDEP).Two variants of Endurance were submitted for Decadal deliberation: Endurance-R (R for "Robotic") would deliver samples to a separately landed robotic Earth Return Vehicle (ERV).AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementEndurance-A (A for "Astronaut") would deliver the sample cache to Artemis astronauts near the lunar south pole. The crew would analyze and triage the samples, and return a subset to Earth for analyses in terrestrial laboratories.In its lengthy journey, a dozen key sites would be reached and then studied by rover instruments with select lunar specimens collected.Pushing the envelopeAt the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), technical studies are underway to assess mobility options for a SPA sample return mission.From a robotics standpoint, just how challenging is such an undertaking and how best to draw from rover missions of the past and those now underway?AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMore in ScienceAncient Tablet Etched With Mysterious Language Found in GeorgiaScienceAlertScientists issue warning after examining arctic animal droppings: 'The polar bears we know now will be very different'The Cool DownWorld's 1st nuclear-diamond battery of its kind could power devices for 1000s of yearsLive Science1,000,000,000,000 Ton Iceberg Breaks Loose in AntarcticaSURFER MagazineJames Keane is a JPL research scientist and was the science champion for the Endurance mission concept study."Endurance is a mission that pushes the envelope," Keane told Space.com.At the moment, NASA's Mars rover Perseverance is the most advanced rover in operation, Keane said. "Endurance would drive roughly 100 times further, drive far faster, and collect roughly 200 times more sample mass than Perseverance. Endurance would also be the first planetary rover to drive at night. This is a mission with a scope that we've never attempted before," he said.Investments in autonomyWhile these are big leaps in robotics, these capabilities have really been enabled by Mars rovers and investments in autonomy back here on Earth.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"Perseverance, for example, is already doing autonomous driving on Mars," said Keane. "This autonomy lets Perseverance accomplish more science, and reach more interesting sample sites.Endurance would drive at a clip some ten times faster than Perseverance, taking into account the maximum speed the rover would have to autonomously navigate, Keane said. The machine would need to autonomously operate, and drive across the full lunar day-night cycle, he added, under a broader range of lighting conditions and thermal extremes.an illustration of a four-wheeled robot with long extendable armsDiverse samplesAs a primary goal, the Endurance to-do list is collecting geologically diverse samples from sites across the enormous South Pole-Aitken basin."The central challenge with this is that SPA is huge," said Keane. It's the largest impact basin on the moon, over 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers) across. The key sample sites are often separated by hundreds of kilometers.an illustration of a four-wheeled robot with long extendable arms"Contrast this to craters we've roved on Mars," Keane pointed out. SPA is 12 times larger than Gale crater, the home of NASA's Curiosity Mars rover, and 44 times larger than Jezero crater, where Perseverance is roaming.AdvertisementAdvertisement"To drive this extreme distance in a reasonable amount of time — all while on the farside of the moon with limited surface data and outside of direct communications to Earth — really requires autonomous driving between sample sites," Keane continued.Reasoning and decision-makingan illustration of a four-wheeled robot with long extendable armsAdvertisementAdvertisementOnce Endurance arrives at sample sites, researchers expect to operate in more traditional "ground-in-the-loop" modes so that scientists on Earth can investigate those sites and collect samples.Operation teams here on Earth would also be engaged in strategically planning and adjusting the route of Endurance at a much lower cadence per distance traveled. In addition, Earth controllers would also monitor rover telemetry to track performance and component degradations of the robot — and adjust the plan accordingly.Nevertheless, the rover would have a greater degree of onboard autonomy for situational assessment, reasoning, and decision-making, Keane said. That involves on-duty work for long durations under challenging lighting and thermal conditions than prior missions, he said.Endurance operators would also be engaged in assessing and handling faults across this long journey across the vast gigantic South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin.AdvertisementAdvertisement"The outcome of all this is an unprecedented level of planetary surface productivity," Keane concludes.Prioritized science goalsMeanwhile, while scoping out the technical and procedural challenges that Endeavor would face is underway, NASA's Science Mission Directorate is kicking off the South Pole-Aitken Basin sample Return and eXploration (SPARX) Science Definition Team (SDT).SDT's task is to provide an analysis on prioritized science objectives and requirements and different implementation approaches for a mission dedicated to snag and bag SPA return samples."The SDT's analyses will be used by NASA to inform decisions on the prioritized science goals and implementation of a near-term SPA Sample Return and Exploration mission," through both human and/or robotic implementation paths, NASA Headquarters tells Space.com.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis SDT is anticipated to kick-off in the first quarter of 2025 and last 12-18 months.a cube-shaped spacecraft on four legs sits on the dusty surface of the moon while a silver cylinder shape rockets off from the top of it above a cone of fireWanted: "moon moola"There's no doubt that extensive travel around the SPA is a tough assignment. But so too is finding the "moon moola" to carry out the task."The Endurance rover concept requires a rover never designed before for the harsh lunar environment," said Clive Neal, a leading moon exploration specialist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.Neal told Space.com that Endurance is being considered as a directed mission through the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program (LDEP).That program also currently funds NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, the soon-to-launch Lunar Trailblazer, the already operating Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), along with the space agency's now-in-limbo Artemis lunar rover, the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, or VIPER, advised Neal.Budget, program concernsRELATED STORIES:AdvertisementAdvertisement— NASA cancels $450 million VIPER moon rover due to budget concerns— NASA gives Intuitive Machines $117 million for 2027 mission to moon's south pole— The moon's oldest crater is super round - and that's great news for NASA's Artemis astronauts"The complexity of the rover required for a successful mission, the collection of SPA samples, will require most if not all of the LDEP budget for the foreseeable future," said Neal. "While the science return is huge, so is the cost, which will dwarf that spent on VIPER," he said.Bottom line from Neal: "I can't see it being implemented in a way to ensure success through LDEP. It requires its own mission budget wedge otherwise we can say goodbye to the CLPS program."Ironically, Neal observed, cost overruns by VIPER that would have jeopardized other CLPS missions have been cited as the reason for canceling that particular rover mission."I can see history repeating itself here," Neal concluded.For detailed information on the rover, see NASA's document titled "Endurance: Lunar South Pole-Aitken Basin Traverse and Sample Return Rover."AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword17,967 people played the daily Crossword recently.

(AP Photo/Daniel Cole)ASSOCIATED PRESSAfter heat records were smashed and a torrent of extreme weather events rocked countless countries in 2023, some climate scientists believed that the waning of the El Nino weather pattern could mean 2024 would be slightly cooler.It didn’t happen that way.This year is expected to break 2023’s global average temperature record and the effects of the warming — more powerful hurricanes, floods, wildfires and suffocating heat — have upended lives and livelihoods.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAll year, Associated Press photographers around the globe have captured moments, from the brutality unleashed during extreme weather events to human resilience in the face of hardship, that tell the story of a changing Earth.January: Experiencing a changing worldAs seas rise, salty ocean water of the Pacific encroaches on Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, hurting agriculture and the farmers and sellers who rely on it. Life for those on the Mekong now – paddling across markets and working and sleeping from houseboats – is quickly being altered. In Tahiti, the arrival of the Paris Olympics this year meant giant structures were built on one of their most precious reefs. The reefs sustain the life of sea creatures and in turn, the people of the island.February: Farming against tougher oddsAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementIn many parts of the world, there were impacts when agriculture intersected with climate change. In Spain and other European countries, farmers were upset over increasing energy and fertilizer costs, cheaper farm imports entering the European Union and pesticide regulations, arguing all these changes could force them out of business. In Kenya, access to water continued to be a struggle for many, while fishers off the Indian coast of Mumbai had to contend with a rapidly warming Arabian Sea. There were bright spots, however, such as the increasing use of natural farming techniques that are more resistant to climate shocks.March: Struggling to get waterMore than 2 billion people around the world don’t have access to safely managed drinking water, according to the United Nations, a grim reality experienced in so many places. In Brazil, some residents collected water as it came down a mountain, while in India others filled up jugs from a street drain. Drinking from such sources can lead to many waterborne illnesses.April: Fighting to thriveAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMore in WorldTrail Runner Tina Lewis Arrested in India for Traveling With an InReach DeviceExplorersWebMoving abroad can be expensive: These 5 countries will 'pay' you to move thereUSA TODAYMy husband and I moved to a small Italian town with $1 homes. We were anxious it would be a lifeless place but were pleasantly surprised.INSIDERUkraine says North Koreans took heavy casualties during weekend attack in Kursk regionCNNFor the Ojibwe tribe in the United States, spearfishing is an important tradition, one they maintained this year in the face of climate change. At the same time, in other parts of the world the impact of climate change was so severe that simply surviving was the best hope. Such was the case in Kenya, where floods took lives and forced many to evacuate, and in an Indian village where flooding is so constant that residents are constantly displaced.May: Getting forced from homeWhen heavy rains led to massive flooding in Uruguay and Brazil, residents were forced from their homes. In both of these places, most people likely returned and were able to rebuild their lives. In other places, there was no going back. Such was the case for Quinault Indian Nation in the U.S., in the process of being relocated inland as coastal erosion threaten their homes. The Gardi Sugdub island off the coast of Panama faced a similar fate — hundreds of families are relocating to the mainland as sea levels rise.June: Suffering from heatAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementFrom Mexico to Pakistan and beyond, high temperatures hit people hard. Unable to find relief, some sweated profusely while others ended up hospitalized. Many would die, such as in Saudi Arabia, where heat related illnesses killed more than 1,300 during the annual hajj pilgrimage. The heat didn't just impact people, but also oceans and animals, putting at risk some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, such as Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.July: California burningRising temperatures and prolonged droughts create conditions for more and longer burning wildfires. One of the places that is consistently hard hit is the U.S. state of California. This year was no exception. Wildfires burned more than 1 million acres, chewed through hundreds of homes and led thousands of people to evacuate. As happens in every fire, countless animals also perished or were forced from their habitats.August: Mother nature shining throughAdvertisementAdvertisementFor all the destruction that climate change caused in 2024, mother nature showed off its beauty. That was on display at Churchill, Manitoba, a northern Canadian town that revels in its unofficial title as polar bear capital of the world. Like every year, tourists enjoyed stunning views of the Hudson Bay, watched beluga whales swim and, of course, came into contact with polar bears.September: Raging watersWater is central for humans and animals, but it can also take lives and leave a path of destruction. It did both in 2024. The scenes were shocking: students in India using rope to cross a flooded street, a little girl in Cuba floating in a container and Nigerians wading through floodwaters after a dam collapsed in the wake of heavy rains.October: Experiencing extremesAdvertisementAdvertisementThroughout the year, there was way too much water in some places and not enough in others, increasingly common as climate change alters natural weather patterns. In the Sahara Desert in Morocco, heavy rain left sand dunes with pools of water. By contrast, the Amazon region in South America, normally lush as a largely tropical area, experienced severe drought.November: Astonishing destructionAround the world, numerous storms unleashed powerful winds and dumped large amounts of water. The result: buildings and homes that looked like they had been hit with a wrecking ball, clothes and other household goods caked in mud and scattered on the ground, and residents walking through floodwaters.December: Looking to 2025AdvertisementAdvertisementAs the end of 2024 approached, the arrival of winter in the Northern Hemisphere meant relief from the heat in the form of cold temperatures and idyllic scenes like snow-frosted trees. But there were also reminders that global warming had already altered Earth so much that climate-driven disasters, such as raging wildfires even during winter months, are never far off. While impossible to predict when and where disaster may strike, one thing is all but certain in 2025: the storms, floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires will continue.___The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
